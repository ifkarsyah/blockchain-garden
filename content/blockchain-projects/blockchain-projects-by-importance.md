7. **Security Best Practices**
   - **Smart Contract Security:** Preventing common vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks, integer overflows.
   - **Auditing Tools (MythX, OpenZeppelin):** Tools and practices for auditing smart contracts.
   - **Wallet Security:** Understanding how to secure wallets and private keys.

8. **Decentralized Storage**
   - **Filecoin (FIL), Arweave (AR):** Key concepts in decentralized data storage, critical for certain dApps.

### **What Is Good to Know (Secondary Skills)**
1. **Advanced Cryptography**
   - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs):** Useful in privacy-preserving technologies and scaling solutions.
   - **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):** Deeper understanding of the cryptography behind key generation.

2. **Alternative Smart Contract Platforms**
   - **Solana (SOL):** Understanding a high-performance blockchain for specific use cases.
   - **Cardano (ADA):** Knowledge of another significant platform with unique consensus mechanisms.

3. **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**
   - **ERC-721/1155 Standards:** Understanding how NFTs are created and traded.
   - **Flow, Tezos:** Alternative blockchains for NFT projects.

4. **Decentralized Identity and Privacy**
   - **Civic, SelfKey:** How blockchain can be used for identity management.
   - **Zcash, Monero:** Privacy coins and their mechanisms.

5. **Oracles**
   - **Chainlink (LINK):** How to integrate off-chain data with blockchain applications.
   - **Band Protocol (BAND):** Another decentralized oracle solution.

6. **Blockchain in Enterprises**
   - **Hyperledger Fabric, Corda:** Enterprise-focused blockchains and their use cases in industry.
   - **Quorum:** Knowledge of private blockchain solutions.

7. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**
   - **Governance Tokens:** Understanding how DAOs function and their role in the ecosystem.

8. **Programming Languages**
   - **Rust:** Increasingly popular for blockchain development (e.g., Solana, Polkadot).
   - **Go:** Used in blockchain platforms like Hyperledger and Ethereum 2.0.

9. **Scaling Solutions**
   - **Plasma, State Channels:** Layer 2 scaling solutions beyond what is absolutely necessary.
   - **Sharding:** Understanding its implementation and potential impact on blockchains.

### **What Is Not Need to Know (Peripheral or Niche)**
1. **Less Popular Blockchains**
   - **EOS, TRON:** Not as widely adopted or influential as other platforms.
   - **Niche Coins (e.g., Dogecoin, Shiba Inu):** Understanding these can be interesting but is not essential for a blockchain engineer.

2. **Specific DeFi Projects**
   - **Smaller DeFi Platforms:** Only relevant if you are specifically interested in a particular project or use case.

3. **Social Media and Content Creation on Blockchain**
   - **Steemit, BitClout:** Niche use cases that might not be relevant depending on your focus.

4. **Metaverse and Gaming**
   - **Decentraland, Axie Infinity:** More relevant if you're focusing on blockchain in gaming, otherwise not essential.

5. **Blockchain for Supply Chain**
   - **VeChain, OriginTrail:** Good to understand but may not be crucial unless you're working in supply chain management.

6. **Specific Blockchain Industry Applications**
   - **Blockchain in Healthcare, Real Estate:** Useful if you plan to specialize in these areas but not essential for general blockchain engineering.

This list should guide you in prioritizing your learning journey as you work towards becoming a blockchain engineer.
