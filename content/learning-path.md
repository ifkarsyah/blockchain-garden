## [[Computer Science Fundamental]]
To grasp the core concepts underlying blockchain and other distributed systems, it's helpful to understand how various computer science fundamentals are interconnected.
1. **Start with Data Structures**: Begin with basic structures like arrays, linked lists, and trees to understand how data can be organized. Most important is Merkle Tree.
2. **Move to Cryptographic Primitives**: Learn about hash functions, public-key cryptography, and digital signatures. These are crucial for understanding how data integrity and security are maintained.
3. **Understand Distributed Systems**: Explore the concepts of ledgers, consensus algorithms, and how they create a decentralized environment.
4. **Dive into Blockchain**: With a solid understanding of data structures and cryptography, delve into how blockchains combine these elements to create secure, distributed ledgers.
5. **Explore Advanced Concepts**: Look into smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, and how they leverage the blockchain’s underlying technology.

## Hands-On Blockchain Development

### Get Involved in Blockchain Network
- **Set Up a Node**: Learn how to set up a node on a blockchain network like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
- **Develop Smart Contracts**: Start with simple smart contracts using Solidity, then move on to more complex contracts.
- **Interact with Blockchain**: Use tools like Web3.js, Ether.js, or Hardhat to interact with blockchain networks.

### Understanding Decentralized Applications (dApps)
- **Frontend Development**: Learn how to build the frontend of dApps using frameworks like React or Angular.
- **Backend Development**: Understand how to set up a backend that interacts with the blockchain, using tools like Node.js and Express.
- **Interfacing with Smart Contracts**: Use APIs and libraries to connect your frontend with smart contracts on the blockchain.

### Security in Blockchain
- **Common Vulnerabilities**: Study vulnerabilities like reentrancy, overflow, and underflow in smart contracts.
- **Security Best Practices**: Learn best practices for writing secure smart contracts and dApps.
- **Auditing**: Understand how to audit smart contracts and use tools like Mythril and Slither.

## Deep Dive Project
### Blockchain
**Bitcoin** is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses **peer-to-peer** technology to **operate with no central authority**: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
